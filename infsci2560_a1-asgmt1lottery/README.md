## Instructions

In this assignment, you will build upon the activities from weeks 1, 2, and 3. Your task is to hand-code a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You must code everything from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No templates or frameworks are allowed in this assignment (save that for assignment two). You are free to Google around for "How do I do X in HTML/CSS/JavaScript." If you find a solution to a particular problem, be sure to include this information in the Coversheet for this assignment.

### Steps

1. Create a new "hello-webpage" project
2. Edit the index.html, styles.css, and script.js to add your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create new HTML pages for each page of your website
4. Tweak your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and refresh the page (Glitch will do automatic page refesh by default, but that will go to the main page and not sub-pages...it is an annoying bug).

### Expectations

You need to build a whole website. The topic can be about anything you want. For example, make a website
about your favorite movies, maybe a page for your top moves in 5 different genres. Or you could make a
personal website eith pages about your hobbies, your coursework, some "blog posts" (I dont expect you to
write a lot of content for posts). I will leave it to you to think about what kind of website you want to
make. Just remember, it must be coded by hand!

### HTML

- At least **5**, well structured, HTML pages - Link the pages together with a navigation pane.
- Use a variety of HTML elements - Each page should have headers, and paragraphs with some text content. Your assignment should have each of the following elements:

  - Table
  - Ordered or Unordered list
  - Image(s)
  - Use the [HTML 5 Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) to in your HTML. This means using the `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`,and `<nav>` elements to give semantics to the structure.
  - Use `<div>` and `<span>` with `class` attributes to identify sections for specific styling.
  - Additional points for using an advanced feature for any of the above elements.

- Validate your HTML Syntax using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and correct any errors.

### CSS

- Create at least **6** unique CSS declaration blocks (that start with a `{` and end with `}`)
- Create at least **12** unique CSS rules across the 6 declaration blocks (rules end in a semicolon (`;`))
- Create a set of CSS style rules that apply to every page in your site
- Use CSS to change the layout the elements on the page (centering images, putting a nav bar at the top or bottom). Basically, you should use CSS to change the location of where an element would normally appear on the page. See this article on [CSS Layouts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction).
- Use CSS to transform the style of text so that it isn't the browser default
- Use CSS to change the style of hyperlinks. This should include at least one pseudo class (eg. active, visited)
- Use CSS to style repeating navigation elements (e.g. nav link to other pages)
- Use CSS to improve the overall aesthetics of your site. This is subjective, but there are some basic priciples you can use (text isn't small, colors don't clash, design is consistent, spelling/grammar, etc.).

### Javascript

- Write at least **2** unique Javascript functions that access HTML elements, modify the page content, and/or create some interactivity.
- Attach a JavaScript event listeners to 2 specific elements and have them change the style and structure of the page (like showing or hiding list items or inverting all of the colors on the site).

### Your Project

#### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

#### ← index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website.

#### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

#### ← script.js

If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
